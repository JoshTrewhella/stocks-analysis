# Stock Analysis
VBA Challenge on refactored stock analysis code

## Overview of Project
Steve's parents have invested into alternative energy by buying into the fund DAQO New Energy Corp. Rather than investing into this broad fund, Steve has asked us to take a closer look at the sector to find some more attractive options and to diversify. By using VBA, we have analyzed DAQO's performance along with other green energy stocks. 
### Purpose
We have refactored our code to run our stock analysis more efficiently in VBA.
## Results
Upon refactoring the code, we ran it for the 2017 year and then ran it again for the 2018 year. The refactored code ran for 0.0859375 seconds for the 2017 year compared to 0.6484375 with the original code. All stocks reported a positive return expect TERP which reported a negative yearly return of -7.2%.
